Hello, world!

My name is Nguyen Xuan Vinh, iOS Software Engineer. I'm currently living at Ho Chi Minh city. I'm mainly focused on iOS native development.

----

When not writing [code](https://github.com/vinhnx?tab=repositories), I love reading [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vinhnx), and exploring open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vinhnx). On my spare time, I occasionally post photos on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vinhnx), I'm also an avid [podcasts](https://vinhnx.github.io/podcasts/) listener.

I have been making apps from my spare time, while learning Apple technologies, like SwiftUI:
+ Clendar - minimal calendar app -- [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clendar-a-calendar-app/id1548102041), [Website](https://vinhnx.github.io/clendar-site)

In the past, I started learning iOS and then end-up creating two iOS independent apps, before starting working fulltime:
+ A markdown text editor with cloud sync [@getWriteDown](https://twitter.com/getWriteDown) -- [website](http://vinhnx.github.io/writedown-site/).
+ A weather forecast app with text-to-speech (think Weather app for busy people) [@HumidTheApp](https://twitter.com/HumidTheApp) -- [website](http://vinhnx.github.io/humid-site/). 

My programming interests include: Swift, Objective-C, iOS. Currently learning: Dart and Flutter. I like: Rust, Go. Love: Open-Source softwares, Git, GitHub, Unix and command-line tools.
