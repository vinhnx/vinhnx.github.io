## Professional Summary

Senior iOS Engineer bridging the gap between native mobile excellence and cutting-edge AI innovation. With 10+ years crafting exceptional iOS experiences, I specialize in integrating advanced AI capabilities—from LLMs to multimodal processing—directly into mobile applications.

### Technical Leadership
Deep expertise in Swift, Objective-C, SwiftUI, and UIKit, combined with hands-on experience implementing production-ready AI solutions. Passionate about exploring the intersection of mobile development and artificial intelligence, particularly in NLP and multimodal data processing.

### Notable Achievements

• Chợ Tốt: Architected the AI-powered Rapid Listing feature (Đăng nhanh bằng AI), streamlining user experience for millions

• VT Chat: Developed an AI research platform for experimenting with conversational AI

• VT Code: Minimal CLI Coding Agent, written in Rust

• VT.ai: Built a multimodal LLM chat application, pushing the boundaries of on-device AI interactions

• Clendar: Created an elegant SwiftUI calendar app that earned Apple's feature recognition

I believe in building technology that genuinely improves people's lives—combining robust engineering with intuitive design and intelligent features that feel magical, not mechanical.

Currently exploring how next-generation AI can transform mobile experiences while maintaining the performance and privacy users expect from native applications.
